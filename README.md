MakerBot-API-Search
===================

I decided to pull the MakerBot API and try my hand at implementing a search bar.  I am making calls to the API and using a couple of regex expressions to substitute images and getting oauth to work.

Any feedback on style or approach is welcome.  A technical write-up of some key features can be found on my blog.

Todo
====

- Improve search feature to make API calls when necessary
- Improve UI elements
- <s>Add a "POST" feature for users to be able to save to a collection for printing later.</s>
